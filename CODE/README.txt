All the required codes are inside this Code folder.


We have provided three main files, named MAIN*.mat. 



We employed three different algorithms for influence maximization:



1. GA (Proposed method) - run: MAIN_GA.m

2. Greedy - run: MAIN_GREEDY.m

3. Random - run: MAIN_RANDOM.m



Other *.m files associated functions. All the dataset files are placed inside.


All the necessary figures will be plotted along with values where required.

Matlab 2018 has been used to create and compile the scripts. In cases,
different Matlab toolboxes might be required if not installed.
Follow the instruction and install the required toolboxes.
